# This is our Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)
#
# See the wiki for our full policy on changing this.
#
# There are two main requirements:
# 1. Bumping the MSRV requires increasing the minor version number (2.7 -> 2.8)
# 2. Changes must be clearly announced in the CHANGELOG.md file
# 3. At a minimum, we must support at least the latest stable rust, minus two releases. 
#    - We can (and very often do) supprot versions much older than this
#
# The first version of Cargo that supports this field was released with Rust 1.56.0.
# In older releases, the field will be ignored, and Cargo will display a warning.
