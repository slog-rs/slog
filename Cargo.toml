# This is our Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)
#
# See the wiki for our full policy on changing this.
#
# There are two main requirements:
# 1. Bumping the MSRV requires increasing the minor version number (2.7 -> 2.8)
# 2. Changes must be clearly announced in the CHANGELOG.md file
# 3. At a minimum, we must support at least the latest stable rust, minus 15 releases.
#    - We can (and very often do) support versions much older than this.
#    - See wiki for for details
#
# The first version of Cargo that supports this field was in Rust 1.56.0.
# In older releases, the field will be ignored, and Cargo will display a warning.
#
# This must be kept in sync with the following places:
# - .github/workflows/test.yml (Github Actions)
# - README.md
# - clippy.toml (Clippy config)
